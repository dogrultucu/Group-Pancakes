## MRAC01(25/26): Workshop 2.1 - Pancake Flipping

## Overview
Our group looked at how a robot could flip a pancake. Our initial conversations were about the act of flipping itself. Would this be:
      1) Flipping the pancake through the air using the motion of the robots arm on the cooking surface
      2) Flipping the pancake by covering the cooking surface with another surface and rotating the robot arm
      3) Flipping the pancake by rotating it around a utensil whilst the cooking surface stayed in the same location

## Getting Started
To first start we chose to each look separately at the above three methods for flipping a pancake. Analysing the first steps separately meant we could think about what was the elemental to the concept or not..


### Prerequisites
In the end we agreed the following initial pancake conditions

      
    -Scotch pancake type
    -Pancake size: ~12cm diameter (~40-45 grams of batter initially)
    -2 teaspoons of oil initially
    -Initially 1 pancake at a time to increase with success
    -Aluminium forged Zircon coating 25cm diameter pancake pan
    -Pan heat to be measured around 185-190 degree Celsius (at centre and sides)
    -using a microfibre cloth towel and water to cool down/ clean pan after each round

In the end we agreed the following initial flipping conditions also

      
    -Clean swipe entire length of pancake followed with 90 degree XY- rotation with spatula to remove pancakes
    -Flip style to use robot arms and motion force generated against lip of pan
